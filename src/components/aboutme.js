            <b>My linkedin intro:</b> Experienced in managing, implementing and working with analytics and reporting solutions for different medium to large customers.<br/>
            A service oriented person with very broad IT, management and cultural knowledge that allows me to make balanced and informed decisions and also communicate effectively across different (Technical/Non-Technical) audiences.<br/>
            I have a very positive attitude towards identifying and tackling business challenges, turning them into business value through the use of data analytics. I love solving problems.<br/>
            <b><h3>However!</h3></b><br/>
            Although this is all true, I have quite a broad interest in several IT Related topics. Since years ago I made my hobby my job. 
            I spend quite some non-work time on projects that I'm interested in to either learn new things or simply because I can.
