           I'm Alex Koppelman and work as a Data Engineer. I am specialised in running projects in which the aim is to move data around, transform and clean it up and make it ready for analysis.

            In my spare time I build stuff. Ranging from ESP32 Arduino projects, Home automation or other technical challenges.
